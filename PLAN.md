# Project Plan

## Problem Statement

The "Pixel & Quill" agency needs a digital tool for assigning tasks, tracking progress and saving these tasks on completion for a longer period of time like over 2 years that's accessible by the entire team anywhere as referenced here in their email.

> No Visibility: I have no clear, at-a-glance overview of who is working on what. Tasks are getting forgotten or duplicated.
> Remote Work is Impossible: One of our best designers now works remotely two days a week, and she's completely disconnected from the board. It's causing delays.
> It's Fragile: The sticky notes fall off, the handwriting can be illegible, and there's no way to track details about a task without cramming tiny text onto a small piece of paper.

## Proposed Solution

- Using social channels (e.g. WhatsApp group, Slack channel)

This solution is easy to use and to adapt to very quickly however it's really hard to record progress on tasks. Writing clear details on an ongoing task is also not very advisable and with increase in scale, information gets really bulky to quickly have a clear glance overview of who is working on what.

- Digital Kanban Software (most suitable solution)

### Cons (❌)

- Setup Time: Requires an initial investment in time to set up the board, columns, user accounts
- Less Immediate: The instant, highly visible nature of the large wall-mounted whiteboard is lost; team members have to actively check the digital board.

### Pros (✅)

- Real-Time Access: Tasks are accessible anywhere, supporting remote work and providing instant status updates
- Detailed Task Information: Each "sticky note" (ticket) can hold attachments, comments, checklists, due dates, and activity history—details impossible on a physical note.
- Familiar Visual Layout: The drag-and-drop card interface is a direct digital translation of sticky notes, making the transition intuitive for your team.

## Must haves

- A board with both the navigation panel and content section area should be rendered after a loading screen is displayed all without first authenticating user Login credentials.

- A navigation panel, that routes to different sections of the dashboard e.g (Home, Tasks, Inbox)

- the Tasks sub-route should be divided into three column (i.e "Tasks for Today", "In Progress", "Successfully Accomplished")

- A task ticket modal card on the board to write/add a task instantly but also can as well be triggered on mouse click to open a form fill in more information about the task ticket like the description, due-date and more important details about the task

- A task ticket can be saved after being declared

- A task ticket can be dragged from one column and dropped in another column

- The contents of the task in the ticket can be edited.

- A user should be able to delete an already assigned ticket.

- Task tickets should be displayed in the order of creation where the last ticket to be created should appear first, and the first ones appear last at the bottom unless the user manually alters the arrangement and moves a ticket to a different position.

> NB: A task ticket is equivalent to a sticky note that was used before on the white board to write and attach a task on the white board.

## Good to haves

- A user must be able to change the color of the ticket to imitate the "sticky notes" nature

- A ticket should be able to disappear on the board when ticked done/complete

- A visual animation should be rendered on the entire screen upon successfully completing all tickets assigned in the day to give a user the sense of accomplishment.
