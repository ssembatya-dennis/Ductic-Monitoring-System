## Problem Statement

The "Pixel & Quill" agency need a digital system that can record & handle tasks safely for a long period of time and that's accesible by the entire anywhere as referenced here in their email.

> No Visibility: I have no clear, at-a-glance overview of who is working on what. Tasks are getting forgotten or duplicated.
> Remote Work is Impossible: One of our best designers now works remotely two days a week, and she's completely disconnected from the board. It's causing delays.
> It's Fragile: The sticky notes fall off, the handwriting can be illegible, and there's no way to track details about a task without cramming tiny text onto a small piece of paper.
