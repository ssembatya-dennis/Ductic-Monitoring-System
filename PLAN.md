# THE DUCTIC MONITORING AND PRODUCTIVITY PROJECT PLAN

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

- The current manual system employed in the organization of attaching sticky notes on a large whiteboard to track ongoing tasks either **pending or completed** issues makes monitoring team workflows and instantly recognizing team acitivity moreso at a bigger scale very challenging since sticky notes are cluttered almost all over the board of which some may fall off and get swept away by wind which puts the agency in another crisis of losing important information on the progress of an ongoing project.

## Solution

Introducing the **Ductic Monitoring and Productivity Web Application** which is a digital system that records every task assigned to each member with the ability to sort tasks and display either for a specific indivual or an entire team in the respective columns _assigned_, _In progress_ and _completed_ together with the ability to change the layout in which to view your tasks either in a list format or a table display layout view which improves visibility and makes monitoring team workflow simple and convenient.

- The digital monitoring system makes assigning tasks to specific indivuals quick and convenient since all you need is to sit down on your machine and assign different individuals different tasks and also your entire team can easily view and update the tasks assingned to them wherever they are without anyone moving with notes around to take to the board which saves time, makes updating tasks instant and real-time and also brigdes the huddle of remote team members who can't physically access the board to as well stay connected and updated with the rest of the team since we now all have access to one "central source of truth".

- Unlike the previous manual system where team members where constrained with the size of the sticky note to only write down summarized details about the task and in a very unreadable small font-size inorder to squeeze everything on this small sheet of paper, the new modern digital tool provides a very clean and beautiful interface where not only can one note down a task but also enjoy the flexibility to easily edit the declared task, write a brief discription of this task to make it more understandable for your employee, add due dates when the task is supposed to be complete and so much more relevant information all displayed in a very nice modal window that can either show a brief or a detailed display with all the information about the task assigned in a very clean and easy to read font

- The new digital system provides you with a feature to `drag and drop` a task from one column to another forexample a member can easily drag a task card from the **"In progress"** column and drop it to the **"completed"** column which makes updating progress on the task very simple and instant and also since the tasks recorded on this application get directly stored on an online storage server like 'google cloud', that also removes the risk of losing important company data about the project progress and makes that data easy to access anywhere and anytime.
